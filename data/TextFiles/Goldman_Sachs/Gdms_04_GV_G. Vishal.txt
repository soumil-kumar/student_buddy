Brief Introduction:
My name is G.Vishal. I am a 4th-year student of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. I interned at Goldman Sachs in the Risk division this summer.

Selection Procedure:
First, there was a written test consisting of some basic programming questions and some objective type questions on Prob. Stats. and basic CS. It was followed by 4 rounds of interviews, which was based on Probability and Stats. and some puzzles. I didn’t have any programming interviews as such.

How to prepare for them:
I think one can do well in the interview with some revision of the basics of Probability Statistics and having some practice on the same topic.
Doing some Coding practice would also help a lot, in general. Geeks for Geeks is a good resource for both in my opinion.

Your Project Details:
My project consisted of creating a new benchmarking model for the existing CVA(credit valuation) calculation system using Neural Networks. It consisted of a lot of math and also needed programming skills. I liked my project because, instead of working on some dummy project, I got to work on a project which I personally felt had a lot of scope for impact.

Company Culture:
The most amazing thing about the company is its culture. The people are really amazing, they are very approachable and friendly as well. I always felt very comfortable with them.GS has a very flat culture, which I felt was really impressive.

According to you who should ideally apply for the intern:
People who like math, quant and want to have an idea of the financial services sector should definitely apply for this internship, as it was surely a very good learning experience for me.

And what advice will you give to them:
I don’t think I am qualified enough to dole out advice in general :), but one thing I would like to say is that believing in oneself really helps a lot.
