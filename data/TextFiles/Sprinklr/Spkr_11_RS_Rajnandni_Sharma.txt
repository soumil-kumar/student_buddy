2) How did you get into Sprinklr? What was the selection procedure?

Thanks to CDC, IIT Kharagpur. Sprinklr came for Campus Placements for the role of APM and PA. A test for one hour was conducted to check the quantitative ability of the students and for the shortlisting procedure for the interviews. We had four rounds of interviews, where three rounds were technical, and the final was an HR round followed by the final selection. In my first round, 3 guesstimates and questions related to my CV were questioned while enquiring about my interest in the organization and aligning the vision. Likewise in my second round, 2 product cases (RCA and Design), cv defenders, and commonly asked in product interview questions like favorite product and how can we enhance the product with fallbacks were asked. The third round was a stress test round where I was given a case to perform in real-time, it was a temperament check while solving the case, and cv defenders as to why I am best suited for this position were focused on. My third round went for almost 1 hour 20 mins where I was thoroughly grilled on my cv and was asked to defend my willingness and fit in the organization by explaining my AI projects and extra-curriculars. The final round was an HR round, where commonly asked questions were repeated like challenges, weakness, strengths, why product, why not consulting? Then, there was a final call for the selection of the candidate.

3) How to prepare for them? What difficulties did you face during this time?

I got shortlists in consulting, product, core and data roles. I prepared for these roles. I highly suggest that irrespective of the role, one should undergo a consult preparation for a week at least, for it leverages the way you can present or express your thoughts, for communication and confidence are game changers in CDC. I practiced GFG puzzles, heard on the street, and 50 Challenging problems, along with CAT quantitative papers for the shortlisting tests. For my interviews, I had thorough mirror-to-mirror practice sessions for my HR rounds and I gave several mock interviews for my HR rounds even to my seniors, because my target roles were consult and product so my expressions and the way I presented myself mattered more. For guesstimates, I solved the top 15 product guesstimates, and Bury the hatchet book. For my consulting preparation, I had case mocks with my peers where I solved cases from Case Interviews Cracked and IIM Ahmedabad’s Casebook for the year 2020. For product preparation, The best starter is the PM Explainer series on YouTube by The PM School. Then, I used a friend’s access to a course of Doraemon Den where they teach you the basics of Product, covering all 5 kinds of cases, like Guesstimates, Root Cause Analysis, Product Design questions, Favorite product and how would you improve it, Go-to-market strategy, pricing questions.

Once, I went through the preliminary understanding of what all of these were like, I read the Decode and Conquer Book and a few important chapters of Cracking the PM Interview. I went through case videos of PM Exponent and The PM school videos on YouTube to see how cases were put forward in an interview.

In the meantime, I practiced cases with my group. A case group is really important we should always practice cases in groups. We should never read cases, reading cases can be the biggest crime you make, for you end up losing a case of your preparation. Moreover, you’re bound to forget the learnings of a case, Every case comes up with a learning that will add on to your case journey, and never in an interview, a case is repeated.

You’ll always meet a new case in a new interview. So, you should be mentally prepared to expect something new even in a case interview. Even if you get stuck, just keep going and take a pause, get help from the interviewer if you’re stuck anywhere, and together you may end up solving the case. Effective Communication is the key player because u need to ask correct questions to get all the preliminary information needed to solve the case. Questions should never be too exhaustive, but crisp and just the ones needed for the case. Vague questions put the interviewer off.

5) How did you manage your time alongside academics and extracurriculars (if any) to prepare for CDC?

I meticulously balanced my extracurricular activities, academics, and campus placement preparation by adopting effective time management and prioritization techniques.

I created a well-structured daily schedule, allocating specific time slots for academics, extracurriculars, and preparation. I always planned my day, and the night before, an Excel sheet with targets. On weekends, I stretched myself a little longer as well with coffee naps, if my targets were undone. I dedicated myself to campus placement readiness, researching companies, practicing interviews, and enhancing my skills. Engaging in extracurriculars not only helped me unwind but also fostered soft skills like leadership and teamwork.

Furthermore, I sought support from mentors and peers, seeking advice on managing the workload effectively. This comprehensive approach enabled me to excel academically, enjoy my passions, and succeed in securing a promising campus placement. Moreover, I was pretty work-a-holic right from my childhood days as a journalist, I balanced my school academics, likewise in college.
