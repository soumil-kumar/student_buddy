1) Brief introduction and description of the offered role

Hello, Abhyank this side. I am a 4th-year student of the Department of Geology and Geophysics and a boarder of Pt. Madan Mohan Malaviya Hall of Residence. I’ll be joining L.E.K. Consulting as part of their Summer Associate Program. With the program, interns are expected to get a thorough experience similar to that of a full-time associate at the company. Getting them to understand the know-how of consulting is their primary objective. Interns work with case teams and participate extensively in real-time client interactions while getting mentored by seasoned consultants.

2) How did you get into L. E. K. Consulting? What was the selection procedure?

L.E.K. began with their introductory session for the students, providing insights into the company and its culture. Following this, the process commenced with the submission of CVs. Approximately ten days prior to the Day 1, shortlists were released based on these resumes. Once shortlisted, all of us were assigned Buddies (current employees) to practice guesstimates and case rounds well ahead of the actual ones.

On Day 1, we encountered an intense but rather exhilarating selection process. It commenced with a senior consultant presenting me with a case study centered around a prominent healthcare entity. Subsequently, I faced a guesstimate round, where I was tasked to estimate the number of Ferris Wheels in the US. These initial rounds were followed by a Partner Round and an HR round, each contributing to the overall evaluation process. The last two rounds were mainly about my resume and past experiences evaluating a cultural fit with the company.

3) How to prepare for them?

When it comes to preparing for consulting interviews, one of the most important steps is to begin by crafting a strong CV. Ensure it showcases a balanced profile, emphasizing your academic accomplishments, previous internships, positions of responsibility (PORs), and involvement in extracurricular activities. Reviewing shortlisted resumes from seniors can provide valuable insights into the expectations and standards.

Explore some resources that will help you become more familiar with guesstimates and case interviews. There are some great YouTube channels out there that offer excellent tutorials. Victor Cheng, Aaditya Agarwal, and IIT Bombay CIC are just a few examples of channels that provide valuable guidance. Gain a deep understanding of frameworks, specifically those related to profitability and market entry, and participate in collaborative practice sessions with a small group of 3–4 peers.

Implement your learnings by practicing with useful sources such as Day One, Case Interviews Cracked, Case Compendium, and other Case Books from the likes of IIM A/B/C. Utilize the opportunity to participate in several practice rounds with seniors and assigned buddies who can provide their expertise to help you refine your approach.

When starting, it’s immensely crucial to focus on structuring your thoughts rather than solely aiming for the correct solution. Select a range of case studies from different industries and employ a MECE (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive) strategy when developing your solutions. Strive for constant improvement after each case, prioritizing the quality of your cases rather than the quantity.

4) When did you start preparing for this role and according to you what is the ideal time for aspirants to begin their preparation?

I started my preparation with a slight delay but was fortunate enough to receive guidance from seniors to compensate for the lost time. I recommend everyone to initiate their preparation by focusing on crafting their CVs initially. This process calls for thorough attention and a significant time commitment.

Ideally, aspiring candidates can kickstart their case prep around June, allowing ample time to gradually ramp up the intensity of these sessions. Starting early provides the advantage of structuring your preparation meticulously and also mitigating the likelihood of last-minute hurdles or rushed efforts.

5) What difficulties did you face while preparing to be at L. E. K. Consulting? How did you overcome them?

Particularly, navigating the compressed timeline between shortlists, buddy rounds, and the actual interviews can be a challenge for many. However, maintaining a robust preparation regimen beforehand was instrumental in overcoming the same. By dedicating sufficient time well before and familiarizing oneself with case interview frameworks, you can be better equipped to navigate the demanding schedule.

Staying connected with seniors emerged as a crucial strategy for managing the anxiety posed during these days. Their first-hand experiences and insights proved invaluable in offering guidance and support throughout the period. Their advice not only helped me stay focused but also provided reassurance during moments of doubt.

6) Are there any specific requirements such as department, CGPA, or other criteria for this position? Additionally, do certain PORs or EAAs enhance one’s chances of securing this internship?

While there are no specific departmental requirements, maintaining a decent CGPA certainly enhances your chances of securing a shortlist. Although there are no hard cutoffs, a higher CGPA is generally advantageous.

Highlighting your involvement with positions of responsibility (PORs) can greatly strengthen your candidature. It showcases your accountability and leadership skills, which are highly valued in the consulting role. Similarly, participation in extracurricular academic activities (EAAs) reflects a well-rounded profile and a genuine interest in fields beyond academics.

Moreover, past internships, especially those relevant to consulting or demonstrating analytical and problem-solving abilities, can further help your application.

7) According to you, who should ideally apply for this job?

Consulting presents an intriguing opportunity for individuals with a natural aptitude for problem-solving and structured thinking. If you are someone who has a knack for solving complex challenges and thrives in fast-paced environments, you can give consulting a try.

It’ll offer you the opportunity to work across a wide range of sectors and collaborate with the best minds to solve complex business and strategy cases. The dynamic and challenging nature of the work creates a unique opportunity for rapid learning and helps you drive meaningful impact around real-world problems.

8) Kindly attach your CV/Resume. What are some of the major points you think would be valid to mention in your CV while targeting this profile?

One valuable piece of advice I received from a senior was to review numerous CVs while staying true to your strengths. If you believe that your academic achievements are your greatest strength, don’t hesitate to showcase them proudly. The same principle applies to internships, PORs, or EAAs. Highlight your unique skills as companies seek individuals with diverse backgrounds and distinctive abilities.

9) Lastly, what advice would you like to give to the students aiming to grab CDC internships this year?

First and foremost, it’s important to maintain perspective throughout the process. While securing an internship is undeniably crucial, it’s important to keep in mind that not obtaining one in no way defines your capabilities. Understanding this perspective can help alleviate unnecessary pressure and allow you to approach the process with a more balanced mindset.

The internship application process can be mentally taxing, so don’t hesitate to reach out to your peers and seniors for support. Engage in open and honest conversations, share experiences, and lean on each other for guidance and encouragement. Remember, we’re all in this together, and supporting one another creates a healthy environment for growth and success as a community.

You need to stay resilient and focus on growth over this period. Regardless of the outcome, view the internship application process as a valuable learning experience. Take the opportunity to reflect on your strengths and areas for development, and use this insight to refine your skills and strategies for future opportunities.
